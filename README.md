# Water Chamber

This is an `ESP32` based water chamber controller.

This project is an example usage of my [EasyNetworkManager](https://github.com/ZanzyTHEbar/EasyNetworkManager) library.

It is a simple web server that allows you to use `GET` requests to read the data coming from a select set of sensors.

## Sensors

This library uses my [EasySensorManager](https://github.com/ZanzyTHEbar/EasySensorManager) library to read the data from the sensors.

Supported sensors:

- DHT11
- DHT22
- DHT21
- SHT31
- DS18B20
- HC-SR04
